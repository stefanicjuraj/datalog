<img align="right" width="150px" src="./public/favicon-logo.svg" />

A curated data catalog of IT (ICT) [**`companies`**](https://), [**`conferences`**](https://), [**`internships`**](https://), [**`education courses`**](https://), [**`certificates`**](https://), and [**`analytics`**](https://) available in Croatia,
within the industry departments of `Information Technology`, `Software Development`, `Web Development`, `IT Services`, and `IT Consulting`.

While the majority of listed entities in the datalog are founded or based in Croatia, there are instances where certain entities conduct their business, offer services and consultancy, have offices, or employ individuals within Croatia while not being headquartered there.

To ensure accuracy and relevancy, regular updates are conducted on a monthly basis. This involves the addition of newly established entities while removing inactive or defunct entities from the datalog. By maintaining this approach, the focus is to offer a reliable and up-to-date resource for seeking information about IT in Croatia.

Contributions from the community are encouraged and more than welcome to further enhance the directory's value and comprehensiveness, allowing users to suggest additions, updates and feedback. Collaboration with the community ensures the directory remains a reliable and robust resource in the IT industry in Croatia.
